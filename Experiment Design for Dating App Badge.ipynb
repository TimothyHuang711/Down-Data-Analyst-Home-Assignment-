This sequential approach ensures a transparent introduction of the feature. Additionally, prioritizing the testing of the addition option for male users before introducing the viewing option for female users aims to avoid unnecessary complexity and potential confounding effects stemming from immediate user reactions.\n","\n","By strategically implementing the addition option for male users first, we aim to establish a clear understanding of the feature's impact. This staged approach sets the foundation for subsequent experiments, allowing for iterative refinement based on empirical data and ultimately enhancing the overall user experience on the dating app.\n","\n","# Hypothesis:\n","Because we implement the manipulation of the badge addition for male users first, we establish the following hypotheses:\n","- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** Displaying a badge on male profiles has no effect on the number of matches they receive from female users.\n","- **Alternative Hypothesis (Ha):** Displaying a badge on male profiles will increase the number of matches they receive from female users.\n","\n","# Cohorts:\n","Male users will be randomly assigned to two groups:\n","- **Control Group:** Male users have no option to add the badge.\n","- **Treatment Group:** Male users have the option to add the badge to their profiles.\n","\n","Further stratification of user allocation based on factors such as location, age, or other relevant demographics ensures diverse representation and minimizes bias, providing insights into the badge's effects across different user segments.\n","\n","# Sample Size & Duration:\n","Considering the extensive user base, the experiment will initially focus on the United States to leverage a large user pool and maximize potential impact. Also, because we expect an increase in male to female matches, we are focus on the users seeking partners of the opposite sex.\n","- **Sample size:** Calculate the required sample size based on a statistical power calculator, considering the desired significance level, power, minimum detectable effect, and measured sample variance.\n","- **Duration:** Run the experiment for a minimum of 2 weeks, considering daily traffic volume and accounting for day-of-week effects and user activity fluctuations.\n","\n","\n","# Events:\n","Instrument the app to track these events for each user:\n","- **Profile viewed:** Record when a user views another user's profile.\n","- **Like received:** Track when a user sends a like to another user.\n","- **Match event:** Monitor when two users send likes to each other, resulting in a match.\n","\n","# Metrics:\n","- Primary Metric:\n"," - **Match rate**: Number of matches divided by the number of profile views.\n","- Secondary Metrics:\n"," - **Badge adoption rate:** Percentage of male users in the treatment group using badges.\n"," - **Like rate:** Percentage of profile views resulting in a like.\n","- Safety Metric:\n"," - **Average profile view:** Monitor the number of profile views by both male and female users.\n","\n","# Reporting:\n","- Summarize statistical analyses of primary and secondary metrics.\n","- Explain unexpected patterns and contradictions.\n","- Clarify insignificant test results and outline experiment limitations.\n","- Investigate patterns in user segments for deeper insights.\n","- Offer recommendations based on test results and findings.\n","- Share the report with relevant stakeholders for decision-making on the badge feature.\n","\n","# Additional Considerations:\n","- Design the badge effectively to communicate intended meaning and value.\n","- Ensure awareness of the badge addition option in the treatment group to encourage adoption.\n","- Monitor the experiment closely to prevent errors, such sample ratio mismatch.\n","- Extended durations may be required to account for potential novelty or primacy effects."],"metadata":{"id":"SfD4YO_5pp5m"}}]}
